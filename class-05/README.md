# Hibernate Steps Project

To implement a Hibernate project, follow these steps:

## Steps to Create a Hibernate Project
1. **POJO**: Define a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) class to map Java objects to database tables.
2. **Mapping File**: Create a Hibernate mapping file (`*.hbm.xml`) to specify the mapping between POJO class and database table.
3. **Configuration File**: Create a `hibernate.cfg.xml` file to provide database connection details and Hibernate configurations.
4. **Client Program**: Write a client program to perform CRUD operations using Hibernate.

## Steps to Write the Client Program
1. **Create a `SessionFactory` object**:
   - This high-level object holds the configuration metadata and serves as a factory for creating `Session` objects.

2. **Create a `Session` object**:
   - Establishes a connection with the database and provides methods to perform database operations.

3. **Create a `Transaction`**:
   - Transactions are mandatory for insert, update, and delete operations (optional for select operations).

4. **Perform CRUD operations**:
   - Use the `Session` object to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database.

5. **Commit or Rollback the Transaction**:
   - Ensure to either commit the transaction to save changes or rollback in case of errors.

6. **Close the Session**:
   - End the session after completing the operations.

7. **Close the SessionFactory**:
   - Close the `SessionFactory` if no more sessions are required.

### Important Points:
- **SessionFactory**:
  - A high-level object that holds configuration metadata and acts as a factory for `Session` objects.
  - It is thread-safe and should be created once per application.

- **Session**:
  - A lightweight, non-thread-safe object used for database operations.
  - In real-time applications, a `Session` object is typically created per request.

- **Transaction**:
  - Mandatory for `insert`, `update`, and `delete` operations to ensure data integrity.

### Flow of Operations:
1. Create `SessionFactory` -> 2. Create `Session` -> 3. Begin `Transaction` -> 4. Perform CRUD -> 5. Commit/Rollback -> 6. Close `Session` -> 7. Close `SessionFactory`

# Maven - Build Tool

Maven is a powerful build tool provided by Apache that automates the build process of Java applications. 

### Features of Maven:
1. **Project Structure**:
   - Creates a standard directory structure for Java projects.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Automatically downloads and adds required JAR files to the project classpath.

3. **Compilation**:
   - Compiles the source code and ensures compatibility.

4. **Testing**:
   - Compiles and executes test cases.

5. **Packaging**:
   - Packages the project into JAR/WAR files for deployment.

6. **Build Automation**:
   - Simplifies repetitive tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging.

With Maven, developers can efficiently manage project dependencies and streamline the build process for Java applications.
