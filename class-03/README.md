# JPA (Java Persistence API)

## What is JPA?

JPA stands for **Java Persistence API**, which is a specification for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Java. It was introduced to standardize ORM tools and simplify switching between them.

### Background:
- Initially, multiple vendors provided ORM tools to bridge the gap between object models and relational models.
- However, developers faced significant issues when switching from one ORM tool to another, as it required modifying significant portions of code.

### Solution:
- To address these challenges, **Sun Microsystems** introduced JPA, a common specification for developers.
- ORM tool vendors then provided implementations of this JPA specification.
- Most of the JPA specification was created by incorporating features from **Hibernate** and **TopLink**.

### JPA Vendors/Providers:
The tools or frameworks that implement the JPA specification are called **JPA Vendors** or **JPA Providers**. Examples include:
- Hibernate
- EclipseLink
- OpenJPA

## Difference Between Using DAO Classes Directly with Hibernate and Using JPA

| Aspect                           | Using Hibernate Directly                              | Using JPA                                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Portability**                  | Switching to another ORM tool requires modifying all DAO classes. | Switching to another ORM tool requires updating only the project configuration file. |
| **Standardization**              | Hibernate-specific.                                 | JPA is a standardized API, vendor-independent. |
| **Ease of Maintenance**          | Tight coupling with Hibernate implementation.       | Loose coupling; promotes better maintainability. |
| **Abstraction**                  | No abstraction layer for switching tools.           | Abstracts the underlying ORM tool, offering flexibility. |

# Features of Hibernate

Hibernate is one of the most popular ORM tools and also serves as a major JPA provider. Some key features include:

### 1. Hibernate Query Language (HQL)
- HQL is an object-oriented query language provided by Hibernate to make DAO classes **database-independent**.
- Unlike SQL, which is **database-dependent**, HQL abstracts database-specific details and uses **Java object references** and **variable names**.

**Example Comparison**:

| Operation                   | SQL Query                          | HQL Query                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Select all rows             | `SELECT * FROM emp;`               | `SELECT e FROM emp e;`             |
| Select specific columns     | `SELECT empName, empAge FROM emp;` | `SELECT e.empName, e.empAge FROM emp e;` |

### Key Benefits of HQL:
- Developers can write queries that are easier to read and maintain.
- HQL queries resemble SQL syntax, reducing the learning curve.
- In SQL, you work with **table names** and **column names**, while in HQL, you work with **class names** and **fields/variables**.

**HQL Example**:
```java
// HQL query
String hql = "SELECT e.empName, e.empAge FROM Employee e";
